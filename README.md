My work in data science

Machine Learning: 

Supervised Machine Learning: 
1) Regression : 

   a) A model using Linear Regression was built to find the chirping rate of crickets for a given temperature.

   b) Linear regression equation for brain weight to body weight was found using which we can find brain weight with the given body weight.
    
   c) Predicting Median value of owner-occupied homes using Linear Regression with regularisation.
   
   d) Using data about the retail price of 2005 General Motors cars best features were selected to predict car price.

2) Classification :

    a) KNN classification was used to built a model to identify the given type of glass using distance metric eucldean and manhattan(euclidean did best)
    
    b) A model was built using Social_Network_Adds data to predict wether a user of social media will buy a car or not.
       
      Model was built using SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, out which Random Forest gives the best model.
      
      
      
Data Analysis : 

  Analysis of two colleges data was done using pandas to find the best student in each department.
